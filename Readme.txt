Glassdoor is a website and online platform that provides information about jobs, salaries, and companies. Job analysis is a systematic approach to defining the job role, description, requirements, responsibilities, evaluation, etc. It helps in finding out the required level of education, skills, knowledge, training, etc for the job position. It also depicts the job worth i.e. measurable effectiveness of the job and contribution of job to the organization. Thus, it effectively contributes to setting up the compensation package for the job position.
Lack of analysis of Glassdoor jobs can result in limited understanding of job market trends, difficulty in finding relevant job opportunities, inability to attract and retain top talent, and lack of insight into company branding and reputation.
The purpose of this project is to conduct an analysis of Glassdoor job postings to gain insights into current and emerging job market trends, identify in-demand skills and experience, and understand how employers can improve their employer branding and reputation to attract and retain top talent.
